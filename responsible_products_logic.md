## Responsible Products Guidelines - Logic Extraction

This document outlines the logic for the Green Star Responsible Products Calculator, based on the 'Responsible Products Guidelines – Version A' document.

### Key Concepts:
- **Responsible Product Value (RPV):** A score assigned to product certification initiatives based on their alignment with technical criteria.
- **Responsible Product:** A product or material with an RPV issued by a GBCA-recognized initiative.

### Categories for Assessment (5 key categories):
1. Responsible
2. Healthy
3. Positive
4. Circular
5. Leadership

### Calculation Methodology (To be extracted):
- How is the RPV calculated based on the 5 categories?
- What are the specific criteria within each category?
- How are points or values assigned for each criterion?
- Are there any weighting factors or thresholds?

### Data Requirements for Calculator (To be extracted):
- What information does the calculator require from project teams?
- What information is stored in the Responsible Products Database?

### Next Steps:
- Analyze the PDF content for detailed scoring mechanisms within each category.
- Identify any formulas, algorithms, or decision trees used in the RPV calculation.
- Document the data inputs and outputs of the calculator.




### Responsible Products Guidelines - Detailed Criteria:

#### 1. Responsible
- **Corporate Commitment on Climate:** Initiative requires manufacturers to be on a trajectory to fully decarbonize products by 2050 or earlier.
- **Environmental Management:** Initiative requires product manufacturers to have processes in place to continuously review and improve their environmental management practices.
- **Carbon Emissions Disclosure:** Initiative requires product manufacturers to have processes in place to continuously review, account, and compensate for Greenhouse Gas emissions from their manufacturing practices.
- **Socially Responsible Extraction of Resources:** Initiative requires that Indigenous Peoples and their rights regarding ownership, use and management of land and resources affected by manufacturing or extraction activities are considered and addressed.
- **Transparent Chain of Custody:** Initiative requires that products have a public and traceable history from raw material source to manufacturing that has been verified by a third party.
- **Environmental Impact Disclosure:** Initiative ensures the quantitative environmental impacts of the product are publicly and transparently declared.

#### 2. Healthy
- **Occupant Health and Safety:** Initiatives that assess products used indoors and emit Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) must meet Occupant Health and Safety requirements.
- **Chemicals of Concern:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Health Impacts Disclosure:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Ingredient Disclosure:** (Further details needed from the document)

#### 3. Positive
- **Energy Use Reduction:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Energy Source:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Impacts to Nature:** (Further details needed from the document)

#### 4. Circular
- **Material Extraction Impact Reduction:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Carbon Emissions Reduction:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Water Use Reduction:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Waste Generation Reduction:** (Further details needed from the document)
- **Packaging:** (Further details needed from the document)

#### 5. Leadership
- To reward initiatives of product suppliers, manufacturer and sourcing initiatives that are deemed new and break barriers, and in turn inspire others to follow.

### Assessing Product Certification Initiatives (RPV Assignment):
- GBCA reviews the initiative’s governance requirements and technical criteria against the Responsible Product’s Guidelines.
- A Responsible Product Value (RPV) is awarded based on the degree of alignment with the technical criteria.
- Products certified by these initiatives will inherit that RPV.
- The RPV is published on the Initiative Score Checker.

### Data Requirements for Calculator:
- **Project Team Input:**
    - Overall cost for all products relevant to each credit (complying and non-complying).
    - List of all compliant products (and certificates for those not in the database).
    - Proof of purchase for selected compliant products.
    - Total cost of works within each of the four building layers: Structure, Envelope, Systems, Finishes.
- **Responsible Products Database:**
    - Contains information provided by recognized initiatives.
    - Collects and merges products with multiple initiatives.
    - Outlines the level of compliance for each product.




#### 2. Healthy (Continued)
- **Chemicals of Concern:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to have processes in place to continuously review and improve their environmental management practices.
- **Health Impacts Disclosure:** The initiative requires quantitative health impacts of the product to be publicly and transparently declared.
- **Ingredient Disclosure:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to publicly and transparently disclose all ingredients in their products.

#### 3. Positive (Continued)
- **Energy Use Reduction:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to have processes in place to continuously review and improve their energy efficiency.
- **Energy Source:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to source their energy from renewable sources.
- **Impacts to Nature:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to have processes in place to continuously review and improve their impact on nature and biodiversity.

#### 4. Circular (Continued)
- **Material Extraction Impact Reduction:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of material extraction.
- **Carbon Emissions Reduction:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to reduce the carbon emissions associated with their products.
- **Water Use Reduction:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to reduce the water consumption associated with their products.
- **Waste Generation Reduction:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to reduce the waste generated during the production and end-of-life of their products.
- **Packaging:** The initiative requires product manufacturers to use sustainable packaging materials and reduce packaging waste.

### RPV Calculation Logic:
- The document states that an RPV is assigned based on the degree of alignment with the technical criteria. It does not provide a specific formula or algorithm for calculating the RPV. It implies a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative one at this stage. The RPV is inferred from the initiative's recognition by GBCA.
- The document mentions a 'Responsible Products Score Checker' which allows users to view the RPV for each product certification initiative and initiative combinations. This suggests that the RPV is a pre-determined value assigned to initiatives, rather than something calculated by the end-user.

### Data Requirements for Calculator (Refinement):
- The calculator primarily takes inputs related to the cost of products and their compliance status with recognized initiatives. It does not seem to perform complex calculations itself, but rather relies on the pre-assigned RPVs of initiatives.
- The core logic for RPV assignment resides with the GBCA's assessment of initiatives against the guidelines, not within the calculator itself.
