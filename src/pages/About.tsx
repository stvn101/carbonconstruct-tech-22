                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                  Founded in 2025 by Steven Jenkins, a carpenter with over 17 years in construction, CarbonConstruct was born from a clear need: the industry lacked simple tools to track and reduce its carbon footprint, making sustainability accessible for builders.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                  Starting as a carbon calculator, it has grown into a robust platform to help builders meet sustainability goals and regulatory demands. Led by its founder, CarbonConstruct is scaling, engaging leaders like Master Builders Queensland, with builders and suppliers soon testing, aiming for 50+ projects in Australia to shape a sustainable future.

                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                  We envision a future where every construction project—from small residential builds to large commercial developments—is meticulously designed, built, and operated with its carbon impact as a primary consideration, ensuring sustainability is at the heart of every decision.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                  By making carbon data accessible, actionable, and seamlessly integrated into standard workflows, we aim to empower the industry to significantly reduce its environmental impact while maintaining profitability and achieving project goals.
