products in
Green Star

Responsible Products Program
With the launch of the Green Star Future Focus program in 2019, GBCA
recognised the opportunity to have a greater impact on the built
environment through the products specified for projects. With buildings
and fitouts contributing to around 50% of resources used worldwide and
about 10% of global greenhouse emissions it was time to turn our focus to
products.

The Responsible Products Program (the Program) seeks to reward the use
of products that have lower environmental impact, are transparent, respect
human rights, and reduce carbon content. Such products are an active part
of the solution for a better future with a more healthy, resilient, positive and
circular built environment.
The Program does not certify or directly recognise products. The Program
aims to achieve its goals by influencing and recognising third-party
product standards, and initiatives. For products to be recognised, the
manufacturers of the products must receive certification by an initiative in
the Responsible Products Score Checker.

Alongside the Program, the GBCA is working to:
•

Create a long-term roadmap to assist industry with navigating the
circular economy dimensions.

•

Drive supply chain transformation to an approach that is more circular,
less carbon intensive, and nature positive.

•

Advocate for a transformative circular economy and nature positive
outcomes.

Responsible
Products
Program

The Responsible Products Guidelines
The Responsible Products Guidelines provide the criteria by which GBCA
recognises product certification initiatives. GBCA assesses initiatives’
standards against the technical criteria and governance requirements in
the guidelines. A Responsible Product Value (RPV) is then assigned to the
standard, depending on the degree of alignment the standard has with the
technical criteria in the guidelines. Products that are certified by these
initiatives will be inferred that RPV.

The Responsible Products Program

Responsible Products Guidelines
Guidelines for initiatives seeking recognition by the GBCA.

GBCA does not recognise products or product manufacturers directly.
The only minimum requirements that apply are:
•
•

Timber certifications must meet the Transparent Chain of Custody
requirements, and;
Initiatives that assess products that are to be used indoors and that
emit Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) must meet the Occupant
Health and Safety requirements.

A ‘Responsible Product’ is defined as a
product or material that has a Responsible
Product Value (RPV) issued by a product
certification initiative recognised by the Green
Building Council of Australia.

Governance Review

Recognition

GBCA receives recognition
requests from:

GBCA reviews the
initiative’s governance
requirements and technical
criteria alongside the
initiatives standard, against
the Responsible Product’s
Guidelines to award a
Responsible Product Value.

GBCA presents the
outcome of the review to
the Responsible Products
Advisory Group1 for the
final determination. A
Responsible Product Value
is endorsed.

Initiative receives Letter of
Recognition with a
Responsible Product Value
(RPV) and this value is
published on the Initiative
Score Checker.

• Product Certification
Initiatives
• Green Star project teams
• Product Manufacturers

GBCA will then send the
initiative governance
requirements and technical
criteria to populate.

Initiatives and manufacturers
can use the marketing
guidelines to promote scores.

(1) The Responsible Products Advisory Group reviews the determination by GBCA staff. The Group is tasked with ensuring the approval process has been followed,

that information was verified and documented, and any final determinations are reasonable based on the evidence provided.

Governance
Requirements

This section outlines the governance requirements to
achieve recognition under the Responsible Products
Program. There are five governance requirements that
must be met by all initiatives, and two expectations
relevant to some initiatives.

Standards quality
The initiative’s standards must be developed to a high
degree of quality and meet the following criteria:
•

The standard has clearly stated objectives. The
initiative shall clearly and explicitly specify the
social, environmental and/or economic objectives
of a standard.

•

The standard has robust criteria for assessment.
Standards shall be expressed in terms of a
combination of process, management and
performance criteria rather than design or
descriptive characteristics. Standards shall not
favour a particular technology or patent(s). There
should be sufficient detail to clearly outline the
exact requirements for achieving compliance with
each criterion.

Note: GBCA reserves the right not to recognise an
initiative or standard should it impact negatively on
GBCA or the Green Star brand.

Registered Entity
The initiative must:
•

Be a legally registered business in Australia or
overseas.

•

Be registered under GBCA’s website and have
provided contact details for CEO and company
secretary. Create an account here.

•

Operate a website with current contact details and
access to all standards and standards content.

•

Recognise building products and/or materials.

Responsible Products Guidelines: Version A

•

The standard must be representative of best
practice. Standards must encourage improvements
above and beyond regulation in Australia. As Green
Star operates in Australia, legislated requirements in
other countries that exceed Australian legislated
requirements can be considered best practice until
such times as Australia’s legislated requirements
are improved.

•

Any targets shall be science-based and clearly
identified. It is expected the initiative has completed
a review, and appropriately referenced, existing
international and national regulations and
standards relevant to inform the benchmarks used.
It is expected that these benchmarks be reviewed
alongside the revision of the standard/s.

•

Claims made by the initiative about certified
products must be compliant with both the ACCC’s
“Greenwashing by businesses in Australia” report
and one of the following:

o ISO 14021 ‘Environmental Labels and
Declarations – Self-Declared
Environmental Claims’ (Type II
Environmental Labelling) requirements, OR
o The Global Reporting Initiative’s
‘Sustainability Reporting Guidelines’.

12

Governance
Requirements

Standard Development Process

Independent Assessment

The initiative must show its standards development process:

The initiative must show that the accreditation awarded to the product
or material is reviewed by a third-party, independent of the initiative.
Accreditations must not be awarded based on self-assessment. The
initiative shall ensure certification decisions are free of conflicts of
interest. Assessments should be performed by accredited auditors
registered by JAS-ANZ (in Australia and New Zealand) or other
national or international auditor accreditation systems, or through a
comprehensive process that demonstrates appropriate independent
training and qualifications for the relevant assessors.

•

Has appropriate governance and representation:

o Including a diverse group of external stakeholders that is
representative of the sector and includes independent
voices, as per ISEAL Code of Good Practice.
o With appropriate processes to ensure all stakeholder
concerns are addressed and consensus is sought in decision
making, with processes in place to address situations where
consensus is not achieved.
•

Ensures public opinion is considered.

o Providing at least one round of public review/comment
period of at least 20 days as part of the process for the
development and revision of standards.

The initiative may:

•

Rely on independent JAS/ANZ auditors to verify compliance

•

Rely on independent third-party auditors that are contracted by the
initiative. The auditors must be required to hold qualifications or
positions relevant to the issues that are being assessed. Their
names and the criteria for their selection must be publicly
available.

o Having processes in place to consider feedback received
from public review/comment.
o Compiling a summary of feedback and the response to such
feedback; to be made publicly available .

•

Has publicly available information delineating:

o The standard and its requirements for current and previous
versions of the standards.

Examples of Auditor Accreditation Systems include:

•

IRCA, www.irca.org

•

IPCA, http://www.ipcaweb.org/

•

JAB, https://www.jab.or.jp/

o Publicly available standard-setting procedures and
summaries of work programmes.
o Standards review and update processes with indicative
timelines.

Responsible Products Guidelines: Version A

Governance
Requirements

Conflict Resolution

Right of reconsideration of decision

The initiative must have a conflict resolution process in place to manage
disputes regarding compliance between an applicant and the certifying
body. The conflict resolution process should:

If an entity (the Complainant) disagrees with a decision of GBCA to
refuse to recognise an initiative, or if the initiative wishes to challenge
a result, the Complainant may seek to have that decision
reconsidered.

•

Recognition
of Initiatives

Include the opportunity for an independent party to help resolve the
dispute.

•

Include a timeframe for completion.

•

Provide the opportunity for appeal.

•

Include a provision to make public the outcome of the grievance
resolution process.

Once the initiative has been assessed, and deemed to qualify for
recognition, GBCA will issue a Letter of Recognition. This contains the
Responsible Product Value the initiative can confer onto the products it
certifies, with the expectation that manufacturers meet the criteria within
the standard. It also shows whether the initiative has met the threshold for
Good Practice or Best Practice under the relevant credits.
Should the threshold for recognition be unmet, GBCA’s Products Team will
send an email explaining the score and the reason for it. The initiative can
accept the outcome, seek clarification, or challenge the result.
GBCA may, at its discretion, amend its determination based on further
evidence from the initiative. This could be done without a formal appeal.

Within 14 days of receiving written notification of the relevant
decision, the Complainant shall give written notice to Responsible
Products Team that it is seeking to have the decision reconsidered
and specifying the grounds for the reconsideration.
Within 14 days of receiving notice from a Complainant, a GBCA
Executive in charge of Green Star (Green Star Executive) shall provide
the Complainant notice in writing of the grounds on which the
decision was made.
The Green Star Executive shall arrange for a meeting between the
Complainant and a senior executive of GBCA, which shall be held on a
date not less than 14 days and not more than 30 days after the
Complainant has received the written grounds for the decision. The
Complainant shall be given at least 7 days’ notice of the time and
place of the meeting. At this meeting, the Complainant shall be
entitled to appear and be heard about the decision it is requesting
reconsideration for.
Within 30 days of the meeting, a senior executive of GBCA shall
provide the Complainant with its decision in writing, together with
reasons.

Should the initiative not agree with GBCA’s decision, it can start an appeal
process.

Responsible Products Guidelines: Version A

14

Recognition
of Initiatives
(Continued)

Right of appeal
If a Complainant wishes to appeal against any decision of a senior
executive of GBCA arising from a reconsideration under this section, the
Complainant shall, within 14 days of having received written notification
of such decision, give written notice to the Company Secretary of GBCA,
seeking determination by an independent person or body.
The Complainant and GBCA shall agree upon the appointment of a
suitable qualified person or body to determine the appeal or, failing such
agreement, the parties shall appoint any person or body recommended
by the President of the Law Society of New South Wales at the request of
either of the Complainant or GBCA. The independent person or body
shall agree a process for both parties to make submissions in respect of
the appeal. The independent person or body shall notify the parties in
writing of its decision together with reasons. Unless otherwise agreed,
the parties shall each bear half the costs of the independent person or
body in hearing the appeal. The appeal shall be scheduled as quickly as
possible after notification is given by the Complainant to GBCA. The
decision of the independent person or body shall be final.

Maintaining
Recognition

To maintain recognition, initiatives must meet the following
requirements:
•

Maintain current contact details on GBCA website

•

Inform GBCA of any changes to the standard

•

Provide timely and accurate communications with regards to Green
Star to their licensees (in accordance with our Marketing Guidelines)

•

Maintain the integrity of their standard and processes

•

Adequately address any issues raised by GBCA on matters that may
impact to the Green Star brand

These requirements are further outlined below.
Recognition is only awarded for the version of the standard reviewed by
GBCA. Should GBCA revise the Guidelines, a transition period will be
introduced, and initiatives may be requested to provide additional
information or updated requirements.
GBCA reserves the right to remove recognition at its discretion should it
deem that any of the above actions have not been met.

Maintain current contact details
From time to time, GBCA will send relevant information to recognised
initiatives. Initiatives are required to maintain at least one representative
from their organisation as a contact person, with their name, role,
current phone number and email address on GBCA’s internal website
(Memberdrive). They can do this by updating their details directly via
their GBCA account.

Responsible Products Guidelines: Version A

15

Maintaining
Recognition
(Continued)

Changes to standards

Maintain integrity of their standard and processes

Initiatives are required to inform GBCA of any changes to their
standards.

Initiatives must maintain the integrity of their standards and business
processes and promptly address any issues. GBCA may consider
media mentions, stakeholder feedback, or similar, when considering
the suitability of an initiative for achieving or maintaining recognition.
Initiatives are expected to ensure their standards are driving change
and delivering products and materials that are improving the built
environment.

Changes to the standard must be sent to GBCA for review, to determine
whether the change/s impact recognition. The changes will be reviewed
by GBCA and may require the initiative to reapply for recognition. In such
a case, GBCA will work with the initiative to define the transition period
whereby licensees will maintain recognition under the old standard prior
to transitioning to the new standard.

Impact to the Green Star brand
Compliance with GBCA’s Marketing Guidelines
When making any references to Green Star, initiatives are required to
comply with the Marketing Guidelines for the Green Building Council of
Australia's Responsible Products Program. These guidelines have been
designed to provide a consistent message to all stakeholders. Please see
the marketing guidelines here.

Initiatives are required to ensure their actions, or those of their
stakeholders (where relevant to the initiative), do not impact the Green
Star brand negatively.

Practice good conduct
An initiative must engage with the GBCA members, customers and the
public in a manner that complies with GBCA’s Code of Conduct. This
means acting with integrity, due care, and in a manner that upholds
the reputation of the works and objectives of the GBCA.

The future of the
Responsible Products
Guidelines
The next version of the guidelines will seek to address feedback received against
the Responsible Products Guidelines – Version A, as well as address the
changes within industry. Initiatives and manufacturers should expect to see
amendments to nature and circularity related credits, as GBCA recognises the
importance of nature disclosure, optimised EPDs, and traceability. Changes
could include performance level amendments, point allocation, or fundamental
changes to credits and criteria.
GBCA expects to consult on the proposed changes in 2025.
All scores against Version A will remain until Version B is released and the
transition period has occurred. GBCA will communicate with the initiatives during
this period and will provide significant time for industry to transition.
